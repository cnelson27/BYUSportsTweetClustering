Sure its not going to happen every year. But 3 straight years and this year trending to be #4 is unacceptable.

Nobody knows if hell be first round. But I think he has the tools to play in the league. I thought he was probably the best qb we played last year and Im worried for that game this year. All the aggies on here need to chill out tho.

Didnt see you specify that. BYU doesnt win as much as they did in the MWC. Makes sense that numbers are down. If they are winning in a P5 conference or winning 10 or 11 games a year against their current schedule attendance would still be upper 50k or lower 60k.
